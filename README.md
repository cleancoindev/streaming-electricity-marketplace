# Streaming Electricity Marketplace

***
## 【Introduction of the Streaming Electricity Marketplace】
- This is a smart contract that allow a buyer to be able to buy electricity with subscription (streaming) plan.
- Streamr and Provable Things are used for implementing this smart contract.

&nbsp;

***

## 【Workflow】
- ① A producer create the energy product.   
  At that time,   
  - an energy product ID is published.  
  - Subscription fees and subscription period are defined by a producer.  
- ② A buyer buy the energy product which they prefer by paying for subscription fees.   
- ③ Once subscription period is expired, a buyer can extend subscription period by paying for subscription fees again.

## 【Remarks】
- Version for following the Streamer smart contract
  - Solidity (Solc): v0.5.16
  - Truffle: v5.1.60
  - web3.js: v1.2.9
  - openzeppelin-solidity: v2.5.0
  - ganache-cli: v6.9.1 (ganache-core: 2.10.2)

## 【Setup】
### ① Install modules
- Install npm modules in the root directory
```
$ npm install
```

<br>

- Install npm modules in the `./ethereum-bridge` directory
```
$ cd ethereum-bridge
$ npm install
```

<br>

### ② Compile & migrate contracts (on local)
```
$ npm run migrate:local
```

<br>

### ③ Test (Mainnet-fork approach)
- 1: Start ganache-cli with mainnet-fork
```
$ ganache-cli --fork https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/{YOUR INFURA KEY}@{BLOCK_NUMBER}
```

<br>

- 2: Start ethereum-bridge
```
$ node bridge -H localhost:8545 -a 1
```

<br>

- 3: Execute test of the smart-contracts (on the local)
  - Test for the StreamingElectricityMarketplace contracts
    `$ npm run test:streaming`  
    ($ truffle test ./test/test-local/StreamingElectricityMarketplace.test.js)
  
  - Test for the ElectricityPriceOracle contract
    `$ npm run test:oracle`
    (truffle test ./test/test-local/ElectricityPriceOracle.test.js)
